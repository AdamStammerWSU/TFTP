# TFTP
This is the repository for a TFTP client project for CS 413 at Winona State University.

Unlike most of my projects, this one was not about design, but about implementation. The design for this project has already been defined within RFC 1350 which can be found within this repository. It served as an educational tool not only in how TFTP operates, but also in the documentation and interpretation of existing designs.
